# Subtle Error in Conditional Handling of Zero in Julia

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Julia code related to conditional statements and the handling of zero. The original code contains an error in how it handles the case when the input `x` is zero. The corrected version addresses this issue by explicitly handling the zero case, which is absent in the original code.  The purpose of this repository is to highlight this type of error and demonstrate a correct solution.
